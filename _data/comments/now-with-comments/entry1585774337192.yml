  Thanks for this blog, I find it very informative. Micro-optimizing (alone or
  within friendly competition - to the extent possible) is really interesting to
  me, but I'm still lacking a lot of knowledge (and ideas for things to
  optimize). I was wondering if there's anywhere to chat about this kind of
  stuff (e.g. Discord)? Thanks!
