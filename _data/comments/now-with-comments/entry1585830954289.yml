message: "Thanks again for the clarification. I am aware that v3 just extends the URL formats and have tried those scenarios. The problem was just i got errors and timeouts, and i totally forget to open the issue with a stacktrace XD. I think it was just some sort of incompatibility with that version of Node.\r\n\r\nAnyway i'm very happy with the setup, i was just stubborn for that v3/bot install... you know... rocket science :-)"
